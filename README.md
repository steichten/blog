The shortest day of the year is always good. I am very glad the days are getting longer from here on out.

# Keyboard


So I got a new keyboard which is very clicky. It has been so many years since I have used a proper keyboard that it is very fun to get back into typing. The laptops and other machines I have had for years have certainly limited my options for key travel and general premium-ness when it comes to typing.

I will have more to do to try and clean up my skills and accuracy to improve my ability to type.
